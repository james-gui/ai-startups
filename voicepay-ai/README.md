# VoicePay AI 💳🤖

**Stripe for AI Voice Agents** - PCI-compliant payment infrastructure that lets voice AI agents collect, process, and confirm payments mid-conversation.

## The Problem

Voice AI agents can handle bookings, customer service, and sales calls—but freeze when it's time to take payment. Current solutions:
- ❌ Awkward handoff to human agents
- ❌ Redirect callers to websites (kills the experience)
- ❌ Hacky workarounds that aren't PCI compliant

## The Solution

VoicePay AI enables seamless in-call payments:

```
AI: "That'll be $47.50. Would you like to pay with the card on file?"
Customer: "Yes, go ahead."
AI: "Payment confirmed. You're all set!"
```

## Key Features

- ✅ **PCI Level 1 Compliant** - Never touch raw card data
- ✅ **Sub-Second Processing** - No awkward pauses
- ✅ **AI Never Hears Data** - Tokenization at every step
- ✅ **Universal Coverage** - Cards, ACH, wallets
- ✅ **Multi-Channel** - Voice today, chat/email tomorrow

## Business Model

- **Transaction fees:** 0.3-0.5% on top of standard processing
- **SaaS tiers:** $299-$999/month for enterprise
- **Target:** Acquisition by Stripe, Twilio, or major CCaaS

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- PCI-compliant tokenization layer

## Getting Started

```bash
cd voicepay-ai
npm install
npm run dev
```

## End Goal

$10-20M ARR → Acquisition at 10-20x revenue multiple.
